# GridWizWeb
 A web app to make custom Grid3 Gridsets

For python 3. You need to install this guys fork of google_images_download and install it (unless the original project do the pull release: https://github.com/hardikvasa/google-images-download/pull/265) https://github.com/therealpeterpython/google-images-download

NB: It doesnt work fully yet. Basic web app working but none of the google image replacement works. Note this is different method than the desktop build.  Read test.py and the notes in the top. 

*it may be easier building a grid 3 parser to do this. If we were to do this then it would have other benefits eg a conversion tool like https://www.openboardformat.org/tools ^
